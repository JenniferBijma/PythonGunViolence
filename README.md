# PythonGunViolence

For my final project for the Data Analyst Program, I had to source my own data. I decided to make an analysis about gun violence in the USA, and found a good dataset.

I conducted multiple steps for data analysis in Python, like data cleaning, correlation tests, regression lines, geographical visualisations, time series analysis,
and even Machine Learning (regression analysis and clustering)

In combination with some work in [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.bijma/viz/GunViolence_17128357874150/GunViolence), I was able to answer the following questions:

1. Is there a trend in gun related violence over the years? Has it increased, decreased, or stayed the same?
2. It there a certain pattern in gun related violence? Is there seasonality?
3. Which states have the most/least gun related violence? Has it always been that way?
4. Where are the gun related hotspots?
